    "My dataset consists of 24 variables, with roughly 1,300 observations. Each observation represents one recipe. Recipes are limited to those for baked goods; specifically, pie, cookies, scones, muffins, brownies and cake. This was accomplished by filtering the data to include only recipes that contain sugar as an ingredient. \n",
